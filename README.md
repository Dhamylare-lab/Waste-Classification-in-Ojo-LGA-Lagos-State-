# Waste Classification in Ojo LGA, Lagos State

This project applies computer vision and machine learning to **automatically classify waste** into categories such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic. The goal is to support **smart waste management** and **promote recycling** in Ojo Local Government Area, Lagos State, Nigeria.

## Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal leads to environmental pollution, blocked drainage systems, and health risks. Manual sorting is inefficient and often overlooked.

## Solution

Using machine learning and image classification, this project aims to assist local waste management systems in:

- Automatically identifying types of waste from images
- Encouraging separation of recyclables and compostables
- Supporting data-driven recycling initiatives

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset of waste images categorized into:

- Plastic
- Paper
- Metal
- Glass
- Organic

*(Note: Dataset is locally stored or pending upload. A public version will be linked when available.)*
