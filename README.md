### üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Images are loaded from directories corresponding to each waste category.
   - Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to enhance model generalization.

2. **Model Architecture**
   - A CNN is constructed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
   - The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

3. **Training & Evaluation**
   - The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss, visualized using plots.

4. **Prediction**
   - The trained model is used to predict the category of new waste images.
   - Predictions are displayed alongside the input images for verification.

### üìä Results

- **Training Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy on the training dataset.
- **Validation Accuracy:** Maintained strong performance on unseen data, indicating good generalization.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Demonstrated effective classification across all waste categories.
